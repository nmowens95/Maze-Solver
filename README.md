This is a maze solving project that uses the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The project uses recursion and Breadth first search in order to solve itself.

How to use:


What I learned:


What I would have done differently:



How to improve:
-Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A*
-Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
-Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
-Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
-Make much larger mazes to solve
-Make it a game where there use chooses directions
-If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
-Make it 3 dimensional
-Time the various algorithms, see which ones are fastest
