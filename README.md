# Maze Solver


This is a maze solving project that uses Python and the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The project uses recursion and Breadth first search algorithms in order to wave through a maze in order to solve itself.

## Installation

Install my-project 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nmowens95/Maze-Solver
  pip install tk
```
    
## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  python3 main.py
```
## Lessons Learned


- Worked with Tkinter library and learned about how a GUI works.
- First introduction of unit testing. Learned a basic understanding on how to implement and use to check during the project.
- Had to figure out how to implement recursion and breadth first search within a project.
- I learned a lot about using different points on a grid and how they interact together.

## Roadmap
- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth first search or A* 
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc 
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster? 
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc -Make much larger mazes to solve 
- Make it a game where there use chooses directions 
- If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm 
- Make it 3 dimensional 
- Time the various algorithms, see which ones are fastest
